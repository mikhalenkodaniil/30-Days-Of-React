// 1. What is an event?
// An event is an action or occurrence recognized by a software. 
// To make an event more clear let's use the daily activities we do when we use a computer such as clicking on a button, 
// hover on an image, pressing a keyboard, scrolling the mouse wheel and etc. 
// In this section, we will focus only some of the mouse and keyboard events. 
// The react documentation has already a detail note about events.
// Handling events in React is very similar to handling elements on DOM elements using pure JavaScript. 
// Some of the syntax difference between handling event in React and pure JavaScript:

// React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
// With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
